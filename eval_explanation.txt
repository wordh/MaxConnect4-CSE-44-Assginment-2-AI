The evaluation function implemented for this assignment is resides in AiPlayer.java with function name as findBestPlay which takes as current gameboard as input and returns as the best possible move by evaluating through alpha beta minimax algorithm.
The main idea is taking the current state, generating the successor states by trying all possible moves, evaluating each of the move and then picking the best of the possible moves.
To this also we keep track of the depth which is number of levels the computer has to think while looking for the best possible move. We have to stop generating the new states after the depth level becomes zero.
In alpha beta pruning, we have to keep track of the best moves found by the both human and computer at every level in the searching tree. As we expand the node at a given depth, we have to update the best value found by the first player (known as alpha). Once the value becomes the best value found by the opponent at the upper level(known as beta), the remaining tree is pruned and return the best value.
